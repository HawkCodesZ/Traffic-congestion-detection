# Traffic Monitoring System

## Introduction
This project implements a traffic monitoring system using computer vision techniques in Python with OpenCV library. It includes modules for background subtraction, vehicle counting, and various image processing operations.

## Installation
Before running the code, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

## Modules

### Background Subtraction
- **File:** `background_subtractor.py`
- **Description:** Implements background subtraction using various techniques like MOG and MOG2 to detect moving objects in a video feed.

### Closing
- **File:** `closing.py`
- **Description:** Applies morphological operations (closing) to clean up noise and detect objects in a video stream.

### Line Detection
- **File:** `line_detection.py`
- **Description:** Detects vehicles crossing a predefined line in a video, counting them based on their movement across the line.

### Main
- **File:** `main.py`
- **Description:** Integrates background subtraction, morphological operations, and contour detection to count vehicles in a video feed.

### Opening
- **File:** `opening.py`
- **Description:** Applies morphological operations (opening) to remove noise and detect objects in a video stream.

### Thresholding
- **File:** `thresholding.py`
- **Description:** Implements simple thresholding techniques to segment objects from the background in a video feed.

### Vehicles
- **File:** `vehicles.py`
- **Description:** Defines classes and methods to track vehicles using object-oriented programming principles, identifying their direction and counting based on their movement.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to each module's directory and execute the respective Python script.
- Ensure the video path (`video.mp4` or `input.mp4`) is correctly set in each script before running.
